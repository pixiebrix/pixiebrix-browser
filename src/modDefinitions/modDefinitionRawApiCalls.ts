/**
 * Fetches the mod definition for the given deployment.
 *
 * Potential performance improvements:
 *
 * 1. Check to see if the mod definition version in IDB matches the requested version. However, there's a small
 *    chance using the local copy would give the incorrect definition in the following sequence:
 *
 *    - Save mod as 1.0.0
 *    - End-user fetches mod
 *    - Save mod as 1.0.0 (incrementing version isn't required because it's not deployed yet)
 *    - Deploy mod as 1.0.0
 *    - End-user fetches deployments and sees the stale mod content
 *
 *    That risk might be with the performance benefits, though.
 *
 *    We could potentially leverage the updated_at timestamp and version, but the IDB registry uses the time
 *    it fetched, not the updated_at timestamp on the package:
 *    @see syncPackages
 *
 * 2. Multiple deployments can theoretically use the same mod version, so we can check if the mod version was already
 *    fetched. But that should rarely occur in practice and handling that won't improve performance significantly.
