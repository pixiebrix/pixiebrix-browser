/**
 * App-like layout component that to define scrollable areas in a specific viewport,
 * without relying on hardcoded heights. Not yet compatible with layouts that have
 * multiple scrollable columns like the editor.
 *
 * .full-height must be used recursively until `html` or until *one* element with a pre-set height.
 * .scrollable-area then specifies which element has scrollable content.
 *
 * @example
 * <body class="full-height">
 *   <div class="full-height">
 *     <header/>
 *     <banner/>
 *     <div class="scrollable"/>
 *   </div>
