PixieBrix is a browser extension and platform for safely extending your favorite websites and SaaS applications
with low/no-code.

In addition to the extension, we maintain [pixiebrix.com](https://www.pixiebrix.com/), a
registry of bricks and pre-made mods. You can create a PixieBrix account to enable
support for team features, such as shared integration configurations and team bricks.

## Our Principles

We're building PixieBrix because we believe three things:

1. There is no such thing as an "average user"
2. Everyone should be empowered to customize their software to give them superpowers
3. Computing should be delightful

We’ve set out to create low/no-code tools for customizing the behavior of software,
web pages, and SaaS. But, we won’t be able to do it alone. That’s why we’re also working
hard to build a diverse and vibrant community of makers.

## Why not _X_?

We're avid users of browser extensions, bookmarklets, and userscripts. They'll always each have
their place. We're building PixieBrix to bring their power to a broader audience. See our Wiki for
